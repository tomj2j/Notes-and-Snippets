Password?123? -> dfgu87zd8734987u9ds8fgu0hj3h4gt9s8452 <<Password-Hashing>>

> > > > cryptographic hasch functions

1. One-way function which is infeasible to invert.
   cant reverse use the function to get the password from the hash
2. Small change in input yields large change int he output
   3.Deterministic - same input yields same output
   4.Unlikely to find 2 outpus with the same value
   5.Password #Hash Functions are deliberatly SLOW
